# AttendanceKeeper
A simple attendance tool to save students' attendance using Tkinter UI.

This was an assignment in one of my programming classes.
There is a sample student's list provided for testing the code.
The UI is simple and self explanatory, it also allows multiple selection.
Output files can be saved as Txt or Xls(Excel).

# How to use
1- Import students from an excel file with the following format (Id, Name, Departement, and Section) Respectively. \s\s
2- Select the section that you will take attendance for. \s\s
3- From the left combobox select the students that attended to move them to the right one. \s\s
4- You can remove any students if any mistakes have been made. \s\s
5- Select the filetype that you want to export the name of the attended students as (txt or excel options for now). \s\s
6- Enter which week you are taking attendance for and the file will be saved with the name of the section + the week. \s\s
