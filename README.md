# AttendanceKeeper
A simple attendance tool to save students' attendance using Tkinter UI.

This was an assignment in one of my programming classes.
There is a sample student's list provided for testing the code.
The UI is simple and self explanatory, it also allows multiple selection.
Output files can be saved as Txt or Xls(Excel).
